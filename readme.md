# RAK11300 C Example

The RAK example code repository for this RP2040 module has a `#include <arduino.h>` at the top.
This helps a lot, because now they can re-use their other modules and existing code on the RP2040 chip.

I wanted to get some "pure-c code" working and also be able to debug that via the SWD port.
